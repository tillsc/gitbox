# Gitbox — friendly & elegant Git version control from 2010

This is the original source code of Gitbox 2010-2012. It was last updated sometime in early 2013, 
but stopped evolving in 2012 when Mac App Store introduced sandboxing and made the clusterfukc of shell out operations 
incompatible with modern OS X requirements. I have made a partial effort to migrate onto libgit2, but that job was left unfinished.

Please feel free to explore my 15-year old Objective-C code. Note that this project was my very first one on OS X :-)

Pull requests are welcome.

## Building

**Requirements:** Xcode (from the App Store) and CMake (`brew install cmake`).

```bash
./build.sh
```

That's it. The script initializes submodules, compiles libgit2, and builds the app. The result ends up in Xcode's DerivedData folder — the script prints the exact path when done.
